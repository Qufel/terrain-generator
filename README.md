# Terrain Generator
This project was meant to be a city builder game, but ended up being a multi-threaded terrain generator. For me, still represents a valid project that is worth showing.
### Generation Settings
You can modify how terrain will be generated based on:
- Seed
- Map length and width in chunks
- Chunk length and width
### Movement
You can traverse generated terrain using:
- WSAD or mouse panning for movement
- Z and X keys for rotating camera
- Mouse scroll for scrolling in and out
Each can be toggled on and off.
